Description: Launch external video player for Jellyfin
 jellyfin-external-player intercepts Jellyfin video playback requests and
 launches an external player (mpv or VLC) instead of the web player.
 .
 Features include:
  * Direct playback in mpv or VLC
  * Resume support with progress sync back to Jellyfin
  * Path mapping for NFS/SMB shares
  * Playlist support for seasons/series
 .
 A browser userscript manager (Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, etc.) is
 required to inject the playback interception script.
